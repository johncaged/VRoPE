- **Symmetric Bias Mitigation**: To counteract the attention bias present in RoPE-based encodings, we design a symmetric positional representation that encodes each spatial coordinate with both positive and negative components. By distributing attention more uniformly across spatial locations, this method prevents positional distortions and improves overall video understanding.
- **Temporal Centered Arrangement**: We propose a center-aligned design that spatially aligns the geometric centers of video frames with the textual arrangement axis, and arranges video frames in temporally ordered progression along the textual positional axis. This transformation not only maintains spatial coherence within video frames but also ensures a smooth transition between video and text tokens, mitigating discontinuities in the positional encoding space.
